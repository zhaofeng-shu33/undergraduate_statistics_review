\section{Vectors in n dimensional space}
A n-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a natural extension of 2 dimensional Euclidean place and 3 dimensional Euclidean space. An n-dimensional vector is represented as a row vector or column vector by $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_n)$ or $\mathbf{a}$
We use $\Sigma$ to denote summation over different values.
